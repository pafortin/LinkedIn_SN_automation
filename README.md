Sales Navigator Accelerator by Anara

Description:
This tool is designed to aid users in automating searches on LinkedIn's Sales Navigator. Users are prompted to provide a list of companies and job titles, and the script automatically generates the corresponding search links.

How does it work?
Opening a new window: Upon executing the script, a new window titled "Sales Navigator Accelerator by Anara" pops up.

Inputting the company list: A text field appears prompting you to paste a list of companies (one per line). After pasting the list, click the "Play" button.

Inputting job titles: Once you've submitted the company list, a new text field will ask you to input job titles (again, one per line). After entering the titles, click the "Let the music play!" button.

Generating search links: The script then takes the list of companies and titles you provided and generates links that lead directly to LinkedIn Sales Navigator search results. These links are opened in new tabs.

Closing the window: After generating and opening all the search links, the "Sales Navigator Accelerator by Anara" window automatically closes.

Technical Details:
The script uses window manipulation to gather information and display results.
User-inputted data is split using the newline character ("\n").
The Sales Navigator URL is manipulated to insert the company and title values provided by the user.
The script is designed to handle a large number of companies by breaking the list into chunks of 50 companies at a time.
